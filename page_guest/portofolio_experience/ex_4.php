            <div class="aboutme2">On 15 October 2023, I had a valuable experience after successfully passing the selection and participating in the HACK4ID training activities at Malang State Polytechnic. During this training, I played an active role in helping to solve problems and provide solutions to Grand Mercure Malang Mirama. This collaboration aims to improve the hotel's performance by involving several MSMEs in Malang Raya.
<br><br>
Within the framework of this project, I contributed in analysing the challenges faced by Grand Mercure Malang Mirama in an effort to improve their hotel performance and services. I worked closely with the team to identify innovative and sustainable solutions that could be implemented by involving local MSMEs around Malang.
<br><br>
My role involved deeply understanding the needs and objectives of Grand Mercure Malang Mirama and ensuring that the proposed solutions could be implemented effectively. I was also involved in communicating and coordinating with the local MSMEs to build a mutually beneficial partnership.
<br><br>
Participation in this project not only provided technical experience, but also honed my teamwork skills, problem analysis, and solution strategies. I hope that the results of our hard work and contributions can help Grand Mercure Malang Mirama achieve their goals in improving performance and providing a better experience to hotel guests.</div>
