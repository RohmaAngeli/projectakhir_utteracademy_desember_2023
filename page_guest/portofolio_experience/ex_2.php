            <div class="aboutme2">As a team operator in events such as Utter Academy webinar activities and industry visits, I have primary responsibility in the technical management and smooth running of the technology during the event. This task involves managing various technical aspects, including the coordination and setup of hardware and software used to ensure that all technology components function optimally.
<br><br>
In addition, my role involves monitoring and handling potential technical issues that may arise during the event. I focused on ensuring that all tools and systems used were running properly, so that participants could experience the event without any disruptive technical hitches.
<br><br>
During industry visits and webinars, I also provide operational support to ensure all logistical and administrative needs are met. This involved coordinating with various relevant parties, including speakers, participants, and organisers, to ensure the smooth running of the entire event.
<br><br>
Playing the role of team operator, I am committed to making a positive contribution to the success of the event, both from a technical and operational perspective. My main goal is to ensure a seamless and satisfying experience for all participants and maintain the quality of the event according to the set standards.</div>
