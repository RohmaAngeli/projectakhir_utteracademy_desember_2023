            <div class="aboutme2">On 27 September 2023, I had the wonderful opportunity to be a speaker at an industrial visit event at Ezy Industries. The event was attended by around 80 students and teachers from SMKN 1 Tapen, Bondowoso, creating an interactive forum that blended practical learning with hands-on industry experience.
<br><br>During the talks, I shared my in-depth knowledge and practical experience in Information Technology (IT). Discussing the latest trends, developments, and challenges faced in the IT industry, I endeavoured to provide a comprehensive understanding to the visiting participants. Through informative and inspiring presentations, my aim was to provide insights that not only focused on theory, but also embraced the realities of working in the field.
<br><br>The interaction with the participants was invaluable, and I enjoyed answering questions and discussing key aspects of the IT world. Moreover, the opportunity to share first-hand experiences with the younger generation, such as the students of SMKN 1 Tapen, provides an opportunity to stimulate their interest in technology and encourage them to pursue a successful career in the future.
<br><br>Through this visit, I hope that each participant can take home new knowledge, motivation, and a clearer view of potential careers in the IT world. Hopefully, this event can be the first step that fuels their passion in pursuing knowledge and expertise in the ever-evolving world of technology.</div>
