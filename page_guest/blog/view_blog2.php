            <p>Welcome to Malang Mirama, a revolutionary platform that not only connects MSMEs through one convenient platform, but also instills sustainability values through the innovative use of Cassava Bag. Let's explore more about the excellent features and innovations that we present.</p>
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <b>1. MSME connectivity:</b>
            <br>•	Malang Mirama allows MSMEs to unite on a single platform that makes it easier for them to promote their products. Each outlet is equipped with a dedicated admin login, providing additional security with a special username and code combination, as well as biometric features.
            <br>
            <b>2. Cassava Bag Seeded:</b>
            <br>•	In an active effort to reduce the use of plastic, we present the unique Cassava Bag.
