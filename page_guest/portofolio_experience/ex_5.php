            <div class="aboutme2">I have attended the Millennials Coding training organised by Utter Academy in collaboration with Rumah BUMN. The training lasted for several months with a series of intensive meetings. During the training programme, we were taught how to create apps using the Flutter framework and Dart programming language.
<br><br>
In addition to understanding the basics of Flutter, we also delved into the concept of modern mobile application development, including how to connect the applications we created with REST APIs. The training material includes practical steps in building responsive and functional applications using Flutter, as well as how to integrate data from the server through the REST API.
<br><br>
The importance of connecting apps with REST APIs is emphasised in this training, providing an in-depth understanding of the communication between mobile apps and servers. In addition, the course also emphasised important aspects of app development, such as state management, routing, and effective user interface design.
<br><br>
I believe that this course gave me a solid foundation in developing mobile applications using Flutter and Dart, and opened up new insights into integration with REST APIs. This experience not only broadened my technical knowledge, but also enhanced practical skills relevant to the demands of today's software development industry.</div>
